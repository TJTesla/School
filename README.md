<h3> Epilepsy </h3>

The Project Epilepsy is a small, fun project, I am working on, whenever I am bored in class. The goal is to make the best Program to make your eyes bleed when you look at it :)


<h4> Other Subjects </h4>

This directory simply hosts Text-Files for other Subjects when I am to bored, to use a Stick, cannot access my School-Account or need to work on it at home.


<h4> All other directories are insignificant Programs from my CS Class </h4>
